# Dashboards

We've included 3 dashboards here:

- **Campaign Overview With Goals:** _Includes general campaign metrics for the quarter as well as goal tracking visualizations and funnel metrics. Note: you'll need to define the goals to use.
  This is built using the first touch attribution model. Switch the underlying fields it's pointing to if another model makes sense._

- **Campaign Lead Details:** _Includes metrics about the leads (or touches) associated with campaigns such as conversion rates and touch count bucketed by lead department, lead job function, campaign type as well as year over year metrics and cohort analysis._

- **Campagin Details:** _Includes metrics about a single campaign. It also uses dynamic filtering by attribution model to easily switch between the various models defined._
