## Salesforce Campaign Block

This block is built for companies collecting campaign data in Salesforce that want to understand how their campaigns are performing.  The code is written in Redshift SQL.

#### What does this Block do for me?

*  Flexible and customizable attribution models defined by **Looker's Marketing Analysts**.
*  Advanced analysis built out such as funnels, conversion rates, and cohorts.
*  Streamlined modeling -- Salesforce modeling can be complex. Get value out of your campaign data faster by using this template and spending your time customizing it based on your company unique needs.

#### Implementation Instructions


Because Salesforce data is highly customizable, there will likely be logic that needs to be updated to fit your company's business logic and definitions as well as fields that need to be changed or added. This is meant to be a starting template.

More details about what's included and implementation instructions are here:

* [Campaign Attribution](campaign_attribution.md)
* [Leads, Contacts, Person Mapping](person_mapping.md)
* [Dashboards](dashboards.md)
