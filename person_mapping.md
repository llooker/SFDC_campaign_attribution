# Person Mapping




### Definitions:
We are using the following definitions here.  Note: some organizations define these differently (such as not using leads or using accounts to specify members further in the sales process). In this case, the model will likely require customization to fit these definitions.

**Lead**: A sales prospect. In this case, it is someone that has typically been identified/touched by a campaign but has not been qualified yet.

**Contact**: A person that can be linked to either an account or opportunity. Typically a lead gets converted into a contact when it's qualified and therefore it then gets associated with an opportunity.



### Person.view:
Because the distinction can be confusing to end users and therefore we want to create a more user friendly explore interface, we've included a person view to coalesce fields from leads and contacts. Fields that are unique to each are still included under the person view label and seperated out via group labels.
